VERY UNTESTED.## Description



The main helpers I used were node-osc node modules 

simply do npm install request and npm install node-osc

 
The code is set to listen on port 8000 


set up as per http://ninjablocks.com/blogs/how-to/7355902-creating-modules-for-fun-and-profit 


Good luck and happy rule making.
